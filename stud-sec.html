        <div class="faq-container">
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is there a deadline to register with a student discount?</h3>
                <p class="faq-ans">Yes, student pricing ends <strong>[two weeks before event]</strong>. To ensure you
                    can take advantage of the discounted rate, we recommend registering as soon as possible. The
                    deadline is strict, and after this period, the regular registration fees will apply. Be sure to
                    double-check the event date and give yourself enough time to complete the registration process!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I need coding experience for the workshops?</h3>
                <p class="faq-ans">No, coding experience is not required! Our workshops are designed to cater to a wide
                    range of skill levels, from complete beginners to those with advanced knowledge. For those who are
                    just starting out, we have beginner-friendly sessions that focus on the basics and gradually build
                    your skills. More experienced participants can attend advanced sessions to dive into complex topics
                    and sharpen their skills further. Our goal is to provide a supportive learning environment for
                    everyone, no matter your starting point.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I participate if I’m not currently enrolled?</h3>
                <p class="faq-ans">Absolutely! While the workshops are primarily aimed at current students, recent
                    graduates are also welcome to participate. If you've graduated within the last year, you are
                    eligible to register and benefit from the same great learning opportunities. We understand that many
                    graduates are eager to continue learning and developing their skills after they leave school, so we
                    strive to make our workshops inclusive for those who have recently completed their studies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Will I get a certificate after completing the workshop?</h3>
                <p class="faq-ans">Yes! Upon completing any of our workshops, you will receive a certificate of
                    completion that acknowledges your participation and the skills you've gained. This certificate can
                    serve as a valuable addition to your resume or portfolio, showcasing your commitment to professional
                    development. It also demonstrates that you’ve gained hands-on experience in the workshop’s subject
                    matter. We believe that certification is an important way to recognize the effort and learning
                    participants put into our workshops!</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How can I contact the organizers?</h3>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What should I bring to the workshop?</h3>
                <p class="faq-ans">For a smooth and productive workshop experience, we recommend bringing the following
                    items: a laptop (with necessary software installed if indicated), a charger to ensure your device
                    doesn’t run out of power during the session, and any questions you might have about the material.
                    It’s also a good idea to bring along a notebook and pen if you prefer taking notes the old-fashioned
                    way. Come prepared to engage, collaborate, and learn, and you’ll make the most out of the workshop!

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Are the workshops in-person or virtual?</h3>
                <p class="faq-ans">We offer both <strong>in-person and virtual options</strong> for our workshops to
                    ensure accessibility for all participants. If you prefer a traditional classroom setting where you
                    can interact directly with instructors and fellow attendees, you can choose an in-person session at
                    one of our designated venues. Alternatively, if you prefer the flexibility of attending from home or
                    need to participate remotely, we have virtual workshops available. Please check the specific details
                    of each workshop session on our event page to confirm the format that works best for you!</p>
